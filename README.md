# Xhgd-MCLauncher
Hello to all of you GitHub folks!
Welcome to our Minecraft launcher developed by Each Studios! This project was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio. Our development language is C# and the development type is a WPF application. We are not looking to make a profit developing this launcher, we just want our application to help more people who can afford to rent a Minecraft server, but don't have launcher development skills. So, after half a year of our efforts, Xhgd launcher was born. You are also welcome to use our project on Github to build your own, more perfect launcher.
Our project is open source on GitHub, but that doesn't mean you can copy our work. We hope that when you use our project, you will note that the core of the launcher was developed by Each Studios.
Have a great day!
